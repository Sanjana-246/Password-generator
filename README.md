Project Description:
Create a command-line password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols).
Allow users to specify password length and character set preferences.

Key Concepts and Challenges:
Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.
User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types.
Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
